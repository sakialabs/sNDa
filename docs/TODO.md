# Roadmap and TODO

Focused list of the next steps with crisp descriptions.

## ML v1

- Compute `urgency_score` baseline (rules or heuristic); persist on `Case`.
- Surface score in sorting and triage; add simple explanations.

## Infra and quality

- CORS/security for deployment; env-var based config.
- Sentry logging and basic rate limiting.
- E2E happy-path test for login → view case → update.
